Access Modifiers:
-->These are keywords in java that help us control the access of classes, variables, methods and other blocks of code.
-->4 Access Levels in Java
    1)Private
        *When private keyword is used with a method or field it is only accessible inside that class.
        *Most restricted access modifier
    2)Default(Not a Keyword)
        *When no access keyword modifier is not used with a field or method then default access is applied by Java.
        *This means we can access this variable or method inside the same class, as well as all the other classes
         inside that same package.
    3)Protected
        *When protected keyword is used with a method or variable, it can be used inside the same class, inside the
         other classes with are in the same package, inside the classes which are in different packages, BUT
         they must have extends relationship within the original class.
    4)Public
        *When we use public access modifiers we can use that field or method anywhere inside the same project.
        *We can access them in the class, in the package, or in other packages within the project.
