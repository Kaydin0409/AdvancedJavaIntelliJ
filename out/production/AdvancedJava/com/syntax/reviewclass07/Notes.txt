Types of variables in Java:
 *We have three types of variables 1)local 2)instance 3)static

 1)Local Variables:
    -->Variables that we declared inside a block of code
    UPSIDE-->They Occupy the memory for shortest period of time
    DOWNSIDE-->They can't be accessed outside that block in which they are declared.
 2)Instance Variables:
    -->The variables that are declared inside a class but outside a block of code
    UPSIDE-->Can be accessed in all the methods of a class.
          -->Can have different values for each instance of that class
 3)Static Variables:
    REAL LIFE USE-->Most of the time you will be storing constant values in static variables.
                    Static is also used heavily with methods that don't involve instance variables.


=================================================================================
Access Modifiers:
*3 Access Modifiers (public, protected,private)& 4 Access Levels(public, protected, default, private)

Rules:
*Access modifiers can only be used with instance and static members of a class(fields and methods)

Private:
    -->When we use private with any method or variable we can only access that method or variable in that class.
    REAL LIFE USE==>99% of the time instance fields are private
                    99% of the time instance and static methods are public

Default: (not keyword)
    -->We can access that member inside the same class inside the same package in other classes

Public:
    -->Public access modifier when used with members of a class,is available throughout the project.
