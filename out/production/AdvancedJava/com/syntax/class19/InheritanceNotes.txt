==>What is inheritance?
    *Inheritance is a mechanism in Java through which we can get the properties and methods from the parent class
     inside the child class.

==>Why we should use inheritance:
    *Inheritance helps us reduce the amount of code that we have to write.
    For Example-->If there are some properties and methods which are present in many classes,
    we can create a parent class for all those properties.  Then we can put the common properties or methods
    inside that parent class and can make children classes extend from that parent class.
    *It is more efficient and saves memory.

==>How can we use inheritance:
    1)Create a parent class
    2)Put all the common methods and properties from children's classes inside that parent class
    3)Use "extends" keyword to inherit from that parent class

==>Types of Inheritance
   *Different languages support different types of inheritance but 5 are most common. (Java supports 3)
    1)Single Inheritance
    2)Multi-level Inheritance
    3)Hierarchical Inheritance
    4)Multiple Inheritance -->not allowed in Java (cannot inherit from 2 parent classes)
    5)Hybrid Inheritance

==>Inheritance Rules:
    1)Private fields and private methods cannot be inherited inside the children's classes
    2)Constructors are not inherited.


    class Parent{
        String name="Newton";
        String eyeColor="brown";
    }

    class Child extends Parent{
    public void printInfo(){
    System.out.printn(name+"eyeColor");
    }
    }
