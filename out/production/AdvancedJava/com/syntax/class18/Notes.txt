What is a Constructor in Java:
    *It is a special block of code that helps us give initial values to the fields of a class.
    *Initialization of object or instance

Why To Use a Constructor:
    1) When we use the constructor to initialize the object, it is more readable and cleaner code.
    2) If the fields of a class are private it's not possible to access them outside a class w/out a constructor
       or method.  This means we can't initialize them without method or constructor
    3) We can enforce rules such as what kind of values are assigned to variables with the help of a constructor.
    4) If we want to make sure that some lines of code are always executed when the object of a class is created,
       we can put that code inside the constructor.

 How to Use a Constructor:
    *We careate constructors inside the class and when an object of that class is
     created the constructor is executed automatically.

    class Car{

    String make;
    String model;

    Car(String carMake, String carModel){
        make=carMake;
        model=carModel;
    }
        public static void main(String[] args){
        Car bmw=new Car("BMW","m4");
    }
    }

    Rules:
    1) Constructors don't have return types, not even void.
    2) The name of the constructor should always be the same as name of the class.
    3) Constructors can't be created with a static keyword. You don't want to create 500 objects with the same variables
    4) We can use any access modifiers with Constructors.
    5) If we don't create a constructor in a class, a default constructor with zero parameters is created by compiler().
