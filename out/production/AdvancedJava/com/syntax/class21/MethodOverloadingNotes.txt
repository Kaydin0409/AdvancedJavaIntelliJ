==>What is Method Overloading:
        *When same name method exists but with different number of parameters or different types of parameters or
         different sequence of parameters it is called Method Overloading.

==>Why We Should Use Method Overloading:
        *Makes code more readable
        *Makes the life of the end users easy, so they don't have to memorize many method names.
        *Cleaner code b/c if multiple methods are doing the same thing, we don't need to have different names

==>How We Can Use Method Overloading:
        *By passing different number of parameters
        *We can change the datatype of parameters
        *We can also overload a method by changing the sequence of parameters

==>Rules:
        *Method names should be same but parameters must be different
        *We can't overload a method by just changing its return type
        *We can also overload constructors by following the same rules of method overloading

class Calculator{

    int sum(int num1, int num2){
        return num1+num2;
    }
    int sum(int num1, int num2, int num3){
        return num1+num2+num3;
    }

    int sum(double num1, int num2){
        return num1+num2;
    }

}
