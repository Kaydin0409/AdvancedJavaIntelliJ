==>What is Method Overriding:
    *Happens when same method exists inside the parent class and the child class

==>Why We Should Override a Method:
    *If we are inheriting from a parent class, and we don't like the implementation of a method from the parent class,
     we can provide our own implementation.
    *Sometimes it is done to improve the performance of the code.

==>How we can override a method:
    *When we inherit from a class we need to rewrite that method inside the child cass.
     All should be the same except the body and access modifiers.

Rules:
    *For override we must inherit from a class
    *The method in the parent class that we want to override must be exactly the same as method in the child class.
     Only the access modifiers can be different.
    *We can only increase visibility when using access modifiers in child class.  Private class can be made public
     in child class.
    *Override can only happen with inheritance
