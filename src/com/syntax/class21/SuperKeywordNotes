==>What is super keyword:
      *Super keyword in Java is used to refer to the parent class object.

==>Why We Should Learn Super Keyword:
      *If we have same name variable or method in the super/parent/base class then we can use the super keyword
       to refer to parent class variable or method because by default, Java prefers the variables of child class.
      *We can also call the super class constructor with the help of super with parenthesis --> super();


==>How to Use Super Keyword:
      *We can use super.methodName or super.fieldName to call the method or to access the field of super class
      *We can also use the super(); to call the super class constructor

==>Rules of Super Keyword:
      *Can only access the immediate parent class constructor, field or method with the help of "super" keyword
      *We can only use super() inside a constructor
      *If we have a user created constructor in the parent class we must have a matching parameter constructor
       inside the child classes as well
      *Super() should be the first line in the child constructor
      *If we have multiple constructors inside the parent as soon as one is matched, we are good to go. We don't need
       to match all constructors in the parent class.
